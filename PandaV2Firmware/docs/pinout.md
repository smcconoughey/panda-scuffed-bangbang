# RTU V2 — Teensy 4.1 Pinout

Extracted from `Microcontroller.SchDoc` (dated 2026-03-31). Confidence levels noted where ambiguous — cross-check against ADC, RS-485, and Power schematic sheets before finalising `pins.h`.

## SPI Bus 0 — ADC1 (MCP3561RT, U23)

Default Teensy SPI (LPSPI4). ADC1 is the 24-bit delta-sigma ADC for the first 8-channel mux group.

| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Connected to |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 10 | CS_1 | MCP3561RT U23 /CS |
| 11 | MOSI | MCP3561RT U23 SDI (shared SPI0 bus) |
| 12 | MISO | MCP3561RT U23 SDO (shared SPI0 bus) |
| 13 | SCK | MCP3561RT U23 SCLK (shared SPI0 bus) |

**IRQ1** (MCP3561RT U23 /INT data-ready): **pin 6**. Active-low, open-drain.

## SPI Bus 1 — ADC2 + MCP23S17 (U38, U35)

Teensy SPI1 (LPSPI3). Shared bus between the second ADC and the I/O expander.

| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Connected to |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 26 / A12 | MOSI2 | MCP3561RT U38 SDI, MCP23S17 SI — *inferred from LPSPI3 pin availability; confirm against ADC2[8A]* |
| 27 / A13 | SCK2 | MCP3561RT U38 SCLK, MCP23S17 SCK — *inferred* |
| 39 / A15 | MISO2 | MCP3561RT U38 SDO, MCP23S17 SO — *inferred* |
| 36 / A16 | CS_2 | MCP3561RT U38 /CS — **confirmed** |
| 37 / A17 | CS_3 | MCP23S17 U35 /CS — **confirmed** |

**IRQ2** (MCP3561RT U38 /INT): **pin 14**. Active-low, open-drain.

**CS pins (read from Microcontroller sheet image):**
- **PIN_IOEXP_CS = 37** (MCP23S17 U35 chip select)
- **PIN_ADC2_CS = 38** (MCP3561RT U38 chip select)

> Both ADCs share their respective SPI bus with the downstream device (MCP23S17 on bus 1). CS lines are distinct. When the bus is idle, both CS must be deasserted high.

## I2C Bus 0 — Power Monitors (INA230, U8/U10/U12)

| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Connected to |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 18 / A4 | SDA | INA230 SDA (3× devices, Power[7A] sheet) |
| 19 / A5 | SCL | INA230 SCL (3× devices, Power[7A] sheet) |

Pull-ups: R44/R45 (4.7 Ω, 0.1%) from +3V3 — confirmed on schematic. **Note:** These are 4.7 Ω not 4.7 kΩ — double-check with the Power sheet; the PDF text reads "4.7 / 0.1% / 100mW" which matches 4.7 Ω power resistors. If these are actually 4.7 kΩ, R&D should confirm part numbers. At 3.3 V I2C must not exceed 400 kHz without verifying pull-up sizing.

INA230 I2C addresses (7-bit), set by A0/A1 pin strapping:

| Device | A1 | A0 | Address |
|--------|----|----|---------|
| U8  | GND | GND | 0x40 |
| U10 | GND | 3V3 | 0x41 |
| U12 | 3V3 | GND | 0x44 |

## UART — RS-485 Transceivers (ISL83491, U32_1/U32_2)

| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Connected to |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 0 / RX1 | RX1 | Serial1 RX → ISL83491 bus 1 RO |
| 1 / TX1 | TX1 | Serial1 TX → ISL83491 bus 1 DI |
| 7 / RX2 | RX2 | Serial2 RX → ISL83491 bus 2 RO |
| 8 / TX2 | TX2 | Serial2 TX → ISL83491 bus 2 DI |

**RS-485 DE (direction control) — hardware gap on built board:**

`/RE` is hardwired to GND (receiver always enabled). `DE` is driven by the `BREAK[1..3]` nets in the schematic, but those nets are **not routed to any Teensy GPIO** on the built board. The physical state of DE needs to be confirmed by inspecting the board.

Possible states and consequences:

| DE physical state | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| Tied to 3V3 (always high) | Driver always on. Firmware can transmit. Receiver simultaneously active so Teensy echoes its own TX. Other devices cannot win bus arbitration while this board is powered. |
| Tied to GND (always low) | Driver always off. Board is receive-only. TX calls do nothing on the bus. |
| Floating | ISL83491 has no internal pull on DE — undefined behavior, unreliable in both directions. |

**Recommended fix:** bodge wire from a free Teensy GPIO to the DE test point on each ISL83491. Free GPIO candidates on the built board: pins 9, 15, 16, 17, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, 32. Assign `PIN_RS485_1_DE` and `PIN_RS485_2_DE` in `pins.h` once wired.

**Firmware approach until fixed:** receive-only operation is safe regardless of DE state (receiver always on via `/RE=GND`). Gate any transmit paths behind a `PIN_RS485_x_DE != -1` check so they compile but no-op until the hardware is resolved.

**RS-485 bus physical layer:** 120 Ω termination resistors (R79/R80) are on-board on both A and B lines. ESD protection (PESD2USB5UVT-QR) present on the RJ45 lines. Both ISL83491 VCC pins (13/14) are decoupled via R78 (10 kΩ) from +3V3. The firmware does not need to manage termination or ESD — these are fully passive.

**Note on additional UARTs:** Pins 28/29 (RX7/TX7) and 34/35 (RX8/TX8) are wired in the schematic. Purpose unclear from this sheet — may be for additional serial peripherals or debug. Verify on RS-485/IO sheets before use. Pins 30/31 (CRX3/CTX3) are CAN3 capable — also unassigned from this sheet.

## Analog Mux Channel Select — GPIOs

Three CD74HCT4067 16:1 muxes (U21, U24, U36) route analog inputs to the two ADCs.

### Mux A — feeds ADC1 (via U21)
4-bit address S_A0..S_A3 selects which of 16 channels is routed to ADC1.

| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **5** | S_A0 | Mux A select bit 0 |
| **4** | S_A1 | Mux A select bit 1 |
| **3** | S_A2 | Mux A select bit 2 |
| **2** | S_A3 | Mux A select bit 3 |

### Mux B — feeds ADC1 (via U24)
Second 16:1 mux for ADC1 channel bank B (current sense or second voltage bank).

| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **21 / A7** | S_B0 | Mux B select bit 0 |
| **20 / A6** | S_B1 | Mux B select bit 1 |
| **23 / A9** | S_B2 | Mux B select bit 2 |
| **22 / A8** | S_B3 | Mux B select bit 3 |

### Mux C — feeds ADC2 (via U36)
| Teensy Pin | Net Name | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| *unconfirmed* | S_C0 | CD74HCT4067 pin S0 (IC pin 10) — Teensy GPIO unconfirmed |
| *unconfirmed* | S_C1 | CD74HCT4067 pin S1 (IC pin 11) — Teensy GPIO unconfirmed |
| *unconfirmed* | S_C2 | CD74HCT4067 pin S2 (IC pin 14) — Teensy GPIO unconfirmed |
| *unconfirmed* | S_C3 | CD74HCT4067 pin S3 (IC pin 13) — Teensy GPIO unconfirmed |

> **EN wiring:** Mux C EN (IC pin 15) is hardwired to GND — always active, no firmware enable control. Same assumed for Mux A and B; confirm on ADC1 sheet. Because EN is always asserted, channel glitches during S-line transitions will reach the ADC input. Use the MCP3561RT's built-in OSR/DELAY to absorb settling (~115 ns mux + signal chain RC) before triggering a conversion after any channel change.

## MCP23S17 I/O Expander (U35) — ACTUATE[1..16]

SPI1 bus, CS = pin 37. Hardware address A0=A1=A2=GND → device address 0x00 (SPI opcode: write=0x40, read=0x41).

IOCON.HAEN must be set before address bits matter. Initialize all PORTB and PORTA pins as outputs, OLAT both registers to 0x00 before enabling outputs.

| MCP23S17 Pin | Register Bit | Board Net |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| GPB7 (28) | PORTB[7] | ACTUATE1 |
| GPB6 (27) | PORTB[6] | ACTUATE2 |
| GPB5 (26) | PORTB[5] | ACTUATE3 |
| GPB4 (25) | PORTB[4] | ACTUATE4 |
| GPB3 (24) | PORTB[3] | ACTUATE5 |
| GPB2 (23) | PORTB[2] | ACTUATE6 |
| GPB1 (22) | PORTB[1] | ACTUATE7 |
| GPB0 (21) | PORTB[0] | ACTUATE8 |
| GPA7 (20) | PORTA[7] | ACTUATE9 |
| GPA6 (19) | PORTA[6] | ACTUATE10 |
| GPA5 (18) | PORTA[5] | ACTUATE11 |
| GPA4 (17) | PORTA[4] | ACTUATE12 |
| GPA3 (16) | PORTA[3] | ACTUATE13 |
| GPA2 (15) | PORTA[2] | ACTUATE14 |
| GPA1 (14) | PORTA[1] | ACTUATE15 |
| GPA0 (13) | PORTA[0] | ACTUATE16 |

ACTUATE channels map to the 16-channel NPN transistor array (Q8_1..16, NSS30201MR6T1G) which drives downstream actuators/relays. A single PORTB write covers ACTUATE1–8; a single PORTA write covers ACTUATE9–16. During armed flight phases, OLAT writes must be guarded by a valid-state check before the SPI transaction is committed.

**INTA/INTB** (MCP23S17 interrupt outputs, pins 12/11): purpose unconfirmed on this sheet. Likely unconnected since the MCP23S17 is output-only here.

**RESET** (pin 9): assumed pulled up to 3.3 V — confirm on Power sheet.
